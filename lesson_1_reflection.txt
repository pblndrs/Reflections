was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Save files in some system that allow to check old versions of files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    	More Flexibility
    	DonÂ´t have too much commits
    Cons:
    	Exposed to fail of user

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in coding we could need tracking multiple files together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log, show us the history of commits and git diff allow us to compare between 
    two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Through version control we can return to a previous version of code. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Learn and test git comands.
